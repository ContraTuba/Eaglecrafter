I keep getting a pop-up for eaglecrafter (version from 10/17/2022) to lock my mouse. 
Unfortunately, I am doing this on a school Chromebook and have no idea how to use this app. 
I tried going into the Chrome editor to try and edit the page but it is blocked.
i don't know what to do
Please help me, I am so bored at school and Eaglecraft is the only thing that is entertaining me ðŸ˜­
